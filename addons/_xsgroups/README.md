# xWarn
An addon for [xAdmin](https://github.com/OwjoTheGreat/xadmin) that allows you to warn players for breaking the rules.
It doesn't have a UI, thus it uses the developer console (or chat) to list any warnings a user may have.

# Requirements
[xAdmin](https://github.com/OwjoTheGreat/xadmin). If you don't install this xWarn will throw an error and refuse to work.

# Install/Config
xWarn uses xAdmin's config, just drag this into your addons folder and if needed, look at `lua/xwarn/commands/sv_warn.lua` to change xWarn's commands. If you want to change the way the mywarns / warns command print, look in `lua/xwarn/config/sh_config.lua`.
