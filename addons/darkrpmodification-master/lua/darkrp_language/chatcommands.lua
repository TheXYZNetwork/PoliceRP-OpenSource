English (example) Chat command translation file
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file contains translations for chat command descriptions.
On the left side you see the chat command, on the right side you see the description.
When translating these descriptions, make sure to leave the quotation marks (" ") and commas intact!

= Warning =
Sometimes when DarkRP is updated, new chat commands are added, changed and/or removed.
By default, chat commands that aren't translated will use the English description.
Chat command translations that don't exist are ignored.


= How to translate missing chat commands =
1. Start the server
2. Join it
3. In your console, enter the following command:
	darkrp_translateChatCommands
4. Come back to this file
5. Paste where it says "-- Add new chat command translations under this line:"

= Note =
Make sure the language code is right at the bottom of this file

= Using a language =
Make sure the convar gmod_language is set to your language code. You can do that in a server CFG file.
