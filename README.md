# PoliceRP
This is a reupload of the main PoliceRP server. The reason we didn't make the original repo public is because there is a lot of private data in the git history (Webhook/passwords/paid addon). Here is a fresh reupload with all the sensitive information removed.

# What is included?
Included is the entire policerp server with any paid addons removed. Any public addons used are still in the repo. For the most part, you should be able to just load the server if you create the right database connections and manually create the tables for the required addons
